TASK A1: House price box plots of London by borough

Here I plot the distribution of house prices by borough using a box plot. Key features of this plot are:
  - To improve readability, I have flipped the coordinate axes so that names are visible in the horizontal and plotted house price in £k rather than £
- Ordering the boroughs by house price median improves the appearance and makes the quartile patterns immediately obvious.
- Playing with boxplot and gridline colouring yields (what I hope is!) an attractive plot.
```
# Group by borough
boroughs <- group_by(my_df, district)

# Box plots of price by borough
ggplot(boroughs_mutated, 
       aes(x = reorder(district, price, FUN = median),      # Reorder house price medians
           y = price_x ,
           group = district)) +
geom_boxplot(lwd = 0.5,
             outlier.size = 0.1,
             fill= " light blue") +                         # Change colouring
stat_boxplot(geom ='errorbar')  +           
ylim(0,1000) +
coord_flip() +                                              # Improve readability of borough
theme_minimal() +
xlab("Borough") +
ylab("Price £k") +
ggtitle("House price by borough") +
theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold")) 
```{r}

An alternative way to demonstrate how prices vary by borough in London is through geom_density_ridges, which gives a better idea of the overall density distribution (especially in cases where the data is multi-modal) but is more difficult to see the actual values in a given distribution. Key features of this plot are:
  - As above, boroughs ordered by their median
  - The white outline surrounding the ridge, which is visually appealing
  - Add median line to each ridge (I could have chosen additional quartiles but this looked too fussy)
  - Navy blue bold vertical gridlines but soft horizontal gridlines to emphasise the price £k values but not overpower the distribution itself on the horizontal axis.

```
# Geom density ridges
ggplot(boroughs_mutated,
       aes(x= price_x,
           y = reorder(district, price, FUN = median),      # As above, reorder medians
                             fill = stat(x))) +

TASK A2: Prepare data for plotting by flat level

It was a challenge to extract flat level from SAON. The approach I took was as follows:
  - Used the provided code to extract the SAON.
  - Based on my knowledge of London, I know there are very few properties > 15 stories tall. I used this fact to apply a recursive function which keeps removing digits from the SAON from the left hand side until the value is less than 15.
- I know this will misclassify some flats; for example some flats which are on the first floor will be mis-classified (flat 14 would be incorrectly classified as being on floor 14 for example rather than on floor 1, room 4.) However, these errors would be almost impossible to avoid without manual/much more sophisticated techniques, which is not really the purpose of data visualisation ;)

```
# Select only the properties labeled as flats
flats <- subset(my_df, my_df$property_type == "F" & !(my_df$SAON == ""))

# Retain only the numeric values of the field SAON
flats$SAON <- gsub('\\D+','', flats$SAON)
flats$floor <- as.numeric(flats$SAON)
flats$price_x <- flats$price /1000

# Assume that there are very few buildings with 15+ floors in London; 
# Hence recursively remove right hand side number until SAON <= 15 and assume this is floor
for (i in 1:10) {
  flats$floor <- ifelse(flats$floor > 15, substr(flats$floor, 1, (nchar(flats$floor)-1)), flats$floor)
  flats$floor <- as.numeric(flats$floor) }
```{r}
Here I chose to plot house price by floor using a violin plot. As there do not appear to be significant differences in house price by floor, this plot does not convey a key trend or message. Nonetheless, this information is informative in and of itself.
```
# Price by floor
ggplot(flats,
       aes(x=factor(floor),
       y = price_x))  +
geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8),  
            fill = "brown 2",
            colour= "navyblue" ) +
ylim(0,1000) +
xlab("Floor") +
ylab("Price £k") +
theme_classic() + 
ggtitle("House price by floor") + 
theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"))

TASK B1:Create GeoJSON file

Here I create a GeoJSON file. The steps I take are as follows:
  - Create summary dataframe by postcode showing the max, median, min and mean house prices.
  - Merge with the postcode file supplied.
  - Convert to SpatialPointsDataFrame and save as GeoJSON.

I also chose to merge the dataframe with a shape polygon file, which enables the plotting of district boundaries. The reason for doing this is to allow colouring of individual districts rather than just specific points. 
- This required extracting the district code from the postcode.

```
# Summarise price data by postcode
geo_df = my_data %>% 
    group_by(postcode) %>%
    summarize(price_max = max(price), na.rm = TRUE,
              price_median = median(price), na.rm = TRUE,
              price_min = min(price), na.rm = TRUE,
              price_mean = mean(price), na.rm = TRUE)

# Merge price data with postcode latitude and longitude
geo_df <- merge(geo_df, postcodes ,by="postcode")

# Geo_df is a dataframe with coordinates on cols 8 (LATITUDE) and 9 (LONGITUDE)
#Transfer coordinates to numeric
geo_df$latitude  <- as.numeric(geo_df$latitude)
geo_df$longitude  <- as.numeric(geo_df$longitude)


# Convert to class SpatialPointsDataFrame
geo_df.SP  <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(geo_df[,c(8,9)], geo_df[,-c(8,9)])
str(geo_df.SP)

#Write as geojson
writeOGR(geo_df.SP, 'geo_df.geojson','dataMap', driver='GeoJSON')

# If desired, load as geojson
#loaded_geo_df <- rgdal::readOGR("/Users/chloemaine/Documents/Chloe/BGSE/data_vis_t2/mini_project/geo_df.geojson")

TASK B2: Prepare district polygon data for plotting

    group_by(pc1) %>%
    summarize(price_max = max(price_x), na.rm = FALSE,
              price_median = median(price_x), na.rm = FALSE,
              price_min = min(price_x), na.rm = FALSE,
              price_mean = mean(price_x), na.rm = FALSE) 
              
# Calculate which decile of all UK house district house price medians and means
# each district falls into
# This allows neat plotting by decile
med_deciles <- decile(dist_df$price_median)
mean_deciles <- decile(dist_df$price_mean)

# Bind deciles to df
dist_df <- cbind(dist_df, med_deciles)
dist_df <- cbind(dist_df, mean_deciles)

# Merge calculated district code with shape polygon file
dist_df <- merge(dist_df, districts , by.x = c("pc1"), by.y=c("name"))

TASK B2 & B3: Plot median and mean house prices across the UK

Here I have chosen ggpplot to show house price maps across the UK. I did download both leaflet and QGIS but the performance was too slow on my computer (it's from 2009!)
- The 2 plots for mean and median show which decile the median and mean house price is in across the UK.
- Looking at the data, we can see that in comparing regions, the difference in plotting the median and the mean is not so pronounced and is difficult to observe at a district level. However, we would expect mean to be far more affected by large outliers which we see in house prices and therefore to be disproportionately skewed in London. With more time, I would have done further plots to investigate this difference!

TASK C1 & C2: Plot change in house prices in 2015

- Here I attempt to answer both questions with one graph, by highlighting the change in house prices over 2015 for each decile of the house price distribution.
- The plot is interesting because it shows that that house prices in the higer deciles are more volatile than those in the lower deciles. This may be because houses in higher deciles have more subjective elements of their cost whereas those in lower deciles are based more upon the physical value of the components of the building and the land upon which it is built. Hence higher-end properties are more subject to market shifts.
